# Final_Project

## Presentation

For the final project we decided to address gender violence, specifically obstetric violence, i.e. any type of violence, both verbal and physical, that women experience during pregnancy. 

From the process of selection and cleaning of the ENDIREH database, as well as the implementation of a machine learning model, we seek to answer the following question: is there a relationship between obstetric violence and the place where women go for care during pregnancy (private clinics or social security)?

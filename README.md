# Final_Project

## Presentation

For the final project we decided to address gender violence, specifically obstetric violence, i.e. any type of violence, both verbal and physical, that women experience during pregnancy. 

Our interest arose at the same time due to the information gathered by the ENDIREH (National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships), conducted by INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) during 2021. As in the past edition of the survey (2016), the database included a group of additional questions regarding obstetric violence, which led us to think about the factors that could influence the violence experienced by women during pregnancy. 

The ENDIREH is the main reference on the situation of violence experienced by women in the country. The objective of this survey is to offer public information on the experiences of physical, economic, sexual, emotional and patrimonial violence that women 15 years of age and older have faced in the different areas of their lives, such as intimate partner, family, school, work and community. The survey makes it possible to estimate the main indicators on the prevalence and severity of violence, and at the same time to carry out a comparative exercise with those estimated in previous editions. 

The Survey is conducted every five years and is representative at the national and federative levels. Geographic coverage was divided into four categories: national, national urban, national rural and state. The sample size was 140,784 dwellings at the national level, with 4,371 and 4,426 dwellings as the minimum and maximum, respectively, per state. The sampling scheme was probabilistic, three-stage, stratified and clustered. And the survey period was from October 4 to November 30, 2021.  

From the process of selection and cleaning of the ENDIREH database, as well as the implementation of a machine learning model, we seek to answer the following question: is there a relationship between obstetric violence and the place where women go for care during pregnancy (private clinics or social security)?

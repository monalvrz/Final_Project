# Final_Project

## Presentation

For the final project we decided to address gender violence, specifically obstetric violence, i.e. any type of violence, both verbal and physical, that women experience during pregnancy. 

Our interest arose at the same time due to the information gathered by the ENDIREH (National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships), conducted by INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) during 2021. As in the past edition of the survey (2016), the database included a group of additional questions regarding obstetric violence, which led us to think about the factors that could influence the violence experienced by women during pregnancy. 

The ENDIREH is the main reference on the situation of violence experienced by women in the country. The objective of this survey is to offer public information on the experiences of physical, economic, sexual, emotional and patrimonial violence that women 15 years of age and older have faced in the different areas of their lives, such as intimate partner, family, school, work and community. The survey makes it possible to estimate the main indicators on the prevalence and severity of violence, and at the same time to carry out a comparative exercise with those estimated in previous editions. 

The Survey is conducted every five years and is representative at the national and federative levels. Geographic coverage was divided into four categories: national, national urban, national rural and state. The sample size was 140,784 dwellings at the national level, with 4,371 and 4,426 dwellings as the minimum and maximum, respectively, per state. The sampling scheme was probabilistic, three-stage, stratified and clustered. And the survey period was from October 4 to November 30, 2021.  

From the survey questions and answers, 28 tables were created, in which the information collected is distributed. For this specific project we will work with the TVIV, TSDEM, TB_SEC_III, TB_SEC_IV and TB_SEC_X tables. 

Each of the tables contains the following information: 
-**TVIV**: contains the basic characteristics of the dwellings (services and goods available) as well as the number of persons usually residing there. 
-**TSDem**: contains the socio-demographic, economic and cultural characteristics of each of the persons residing in the dwelling. 
-**TB_SEC_III**: contains the information that identifies the women who are 15 years old and older who reside in the dwelling, and verifies the marital status of the respondent.
-**TB_SEC_IV**: contains basic information about the partner, husband, boyfriend or ex-partner of women who do not reside in the selected woman's household. It also provides information on the earned income of the woman and her partner, as well as other sources of income available to the woman. It delves into the assets and property owned by the persons residing in the dwelling, specifically the woman selected for the survey.
-**TB_SEC_X**: contains information on obstetric care received by women aged 15-49 who had a pregnancy during the last five years. 

From the process of selection and cleaning of the ENDIREH database, as well as the implementation of a machine learning model, we seek to answer the following question: is there a relationship between obstetric violence and the place where women go for care during pregnancy (private clinics or social security)?

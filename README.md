# Final_Project

## Comunnication protocols
The team's communication protocol is through Slack, where we have a specific group where we answer and resolve issues related to the project. In case of any emergency or urgent matter we have the phone numbers of each team member to respond as soon as possible. The group meets in the afternoons to advance and discuss the execution of the project.

The roles were distributed as follows:
- Square role: Mónica Alvarez
- Triangle role: Daniel Sañudo
- Circle role: Cristina Gonzalez 

Although everyone is in charge of a specific role, we all participate actively in the execution of each of the parts and sections that make up the project.
